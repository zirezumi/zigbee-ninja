A self-hosted, containerized observability service for Zigbee networks managed by
Zigbee2MQTT: it measures how much of each coordinator's throughput capacity is in
use, attributes that traffic to its causes, and models mesh airtime amplification —
passive by default, permission-gated everywhere else.

## §1 Mission & scope

zigbee-ninja answers one question with defensible numbers: **how much of each
Zigbee coordinator's throughput capacity is being used — and by what?** It runs
continuously, presents everything through its own web GUI, and is built as a
generic, redistributable product: nothing in the core assumes any particular
home's configuration.

Concretely, it must be able to answer:

- **Utilization & headroom** — per coordinator, against an empirically calibrated
  capacity knee, at both steady-state and burst timescales.
- **Attribution** — which share of traffic is controller-commanded (e.g. Home
  Assistant), which is device reporting, which is housekeeping or retry overhead;
  drill down to device, device class, MQTT client, and (with HA integration) the
  individual automation.
- **Latency health** — command queue delay, mesh round-trip, end-to-end
  command→state-echo; correlation of latency/error onset with load.
- **Planning support** — a per-device load ledger sufficient to evaluate moving
  devices between coordinators or consolidating coordinators away (the interactive
  what-if advisor itself is a fast-follow).
- **Pacing validation** — burst-level views fine enough to judge whether command
  staggering/pacing strategies in the controller are earning their keep.

**V1 scope:** Zigbee2MQTT systems (1..N instances on a single MQTT broker),
standalone Docker deployment, three observation tiers (MQTT, Z2M extension,
passive wire tap), calibration, dashboards, alerting.

**Deliberately deferred:** Home Assistant add-on packaging and ZHA support (both
part of the wider-release MVP that follows V1), the what-if rebalancing advisor,
the inline proxy tier for serial adapters, RF sniffing, multi-broker.

## §2 Design principles

| # | Principle | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| P1 | **Passive by default** | Observation never adds mesh traffic. Active operations — topology pulls, calibration benchmarks — are permission-gated, rate-limited, and individually revocable. |
| P2 | **Consent per foothold** | Every probe deployment is an explicit grant in the GUI, against a named target, revocable later. A footprint page lists everything zigbee-ninja has ever deployed. |
| P3 | **Fail-open** | No V1 probe sits in a required datapath. If zigbee-ninja dies, the mesh never notices. (The future serial-proxy tier is the sole, loudly-labeled exception.) |
| P4 | **Self-accounting** | zigbee-ninja's own MQTT client, topology pulls, and benchmarks are measured and attributed to *itself*, never silently folded into the numbers it reports. |
| P5 | **Confidence-tagged** | Every metric carries a provenance tag — `measured` / `modeled` / `inferred` — surfaced in the GUI, driven by which observation tier produced it. |
| P6 | **Generic core** | All knowledge of the installation comes from discovery and live registries (`bridge/info`, `bridge/devices`, `bridge/groups`). No installation-specific logic in core. |
| P7 | **Single image** | One container: collector, embedded storage, API, and GUI. This is what makes HA add-on packaging a packaging exercise rather than a re-architecture. Multi-arch (amd64/arm64). |
| P8 | **Clean IP** | Apache-2.0; no GPL/AGPL dependencies in distributed artifacts, so the codebase stays commercially forkable (§16). |

## §3 System context

zigbee-ninja sits *beside* the Zigbee stack, never inside it. The broker is the
only mandatory contact point; every other edge is an optional, permission-gated
enrichment.

  subgraph MESH["Zigbee mesh x N"]
    DEV["Devices / routers"] --- COORD["Coordinator"]

```

The V1 deployment target is standalone Docker. The same image later ships as a
Home Assistant add-on, whose constraint — effectively one container, no compose
stacks — is why P7 exists.

## §4 Observation tiers & visibility matrix

Fidelity is tiered. Each tier is independently deployable, and the product
degrades gracefully to whatever the user grants. The GUI presents this as a
per-coordinator **coverage meter**: which tiers are live, and what each missing
tier would add.

### T0 — MQTT firehose *(credentials: broker only)*

Subscribe to each instance's base topic tree plus `$SYS/#`. Sees every command
(`<base>/<target>/set|get`), every state publish, Z2M's bridge log stream
(including BUSY/failure events when enabled), availability transitions, and the
full device/group registries. This tier alone supports message-rate dashboards
and MQTT-level attribution. It cannot see frame sizes, radio timing, retries, or
Z2M-internal radio work.

### T0.5 — Broker publish attribution *(broker-side log reader)*

With debug-level logging enabled, Mosquitto emits per-PUBLISH lines carrying the
**publishing client id** ("Received PUBLISH from `ha-core` …") — turning "a
command arrived" into "client `ha-core` issued this command". The tolerant
parser (`brokerlog.py`) reads those lines.

> **Live correction (2026-07-14, Mosquitto 2.0.22): these debug lines are NOT
> available over MQTT.** `log_dest topic` publishes only notice/subscribe-class
> messages to `$SYS/broker/log/#`; debug-level PUBLISH lines go **only** to
> `stderr`/`file`. So T0.5 cannot be pure-MQTT as originally specified — it
> requires a **broker-side log reader** (tail the journal/file, parse, forward),
> i.e. a foothold on the broker host, not just a config change. On a
> single-controller (HA-only) install the marginal value is also low (nearly
> every command is `ha-core`). **Preferred alternative:** per-*automation*
> attribution via the HA-token integration (§7.4) — broker-safe (read-only HA
> WebSocket) and strictly more informative. Broker debug logging also ~doubles
> broker message volume; measure before enabling.

### T1 — Z2M runtime extension *(credentials: broker only)*

A single-file, dependency-free JS extension deployed *and removed* entirely over
MQTT (`bridge/request/extension/save` / `remove` — confirmed present in Z2M 2.x).
It hooks Z2M's event bus and emits compact batched telemetry: every ZCL frame
in/out at the Z2M boundary with device, cluster, command, sizes, timestamps, and
queue-timing milestones. This is the workhorse tier — it sees Z2M-internal radio
work (availability pings, config readbacks) that never appears on MQTT, and it
works identically for serial and network adapters on any host.

### T2 — Passive wire tap *(host agent, one-liner install)*

For network-attached coordinators, the coordinator↔Z2M link is a long-lived TCP
flow carrying ASH-framed EZSP. A tiny host agent (`ninja-tap`, §7.2) captures
exactly those flows with tcpdump and streams raw pcap to the collector, which
does TCP reassembly and ASH/EZSP decode centrally. This yields exact bytes and
timing for every frame crossing the NCP boundary, per-frame LQI/RSSI on receive,
delivery-status callbacks, and ASH-level link health (retransmits/NAKs on the
wire itself). Because the EmberZNet NCP handles network security, payloads at
this boundary are already decrypted — no network-key handling required.

For serial-USB coordinators there is no passive tap; the equivalent fidelity
requires the **inline proxy** tier (T2b) — a transparent TCP/serial interposer.
It is a product option only, clearly labeled as sitting in the datapath, and is
out of V1 scope.

### T3 — RF sniffer *(reserved, not V1)*

Channel-matched capture hardware would add the only things T2 can't see:
MAC-level retries by remote nodes, CCA busy time, foreign-network and Wi-Fi
contention. The tier is reserved in the data model (a provenance source and
airtime ground-truth input) but not built in V1.

### Visibility matrix

| Signal | T0 | T0.5 | T1 | T2 | T3 |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Commands & state publishes (MQTT level) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Publishing client identity | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Per-frame ZCL detail (device, cluster, command) | ◐ inferred | ◐ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Z2M housekeeping traffic (pings, readbacks) | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Exact frame bytes → airtime | ✗ | ✗ | ◐ near-exact | ✓ | ✓ |
| Queue latency (enqueue → sent → delivered) | ◐ end-to-end echo only | ◐ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Delivery status / APS failure per command | ◐ log stream | ◐ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Per-frame LQI/RSSI on receive | ✗ | ✗ | ◐ | ✓ | ✓ |
| NCP-internal stack housekeeping (link status, routing) | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ◐ counters/residual | ✓ |
| MAC retries, CCA busy, foreign traffic | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | ◐ counters | ✓ |

> **Key structural fact:** on EmberZNet NCPs, NWK-layer housekeeping (link status
> beacons, route maintenance) is generated *inside* the coordinator and never
> crosses the EZSP boundary — so even T2 can't see it per-frame. The plan: poll
> EmberZNet's aggregate counters if an access route proves practical (spike S2),
> and treat *counters − attributed frames* as a measured residual for the
> stack-housekeeping bucket; otherwise model it from protocol constants (link
> status ≈ one one-hop broadcast per router per 15 s) with an honest `modeled` tag.
>
> **S2 resolution: the access route is passive.** Zigbee2MQTT itself issues
> `readAndClearCounters`; the wire tap harvests the responses for free — no
> zigbee-ninja polling, no added NCP work. `decode/counters.py` labels the
> arrays (clean-room UG100 name order, unknown tail indices degrade to
> `counter_NN`), provenance `inferred` until live cross-tier validation
> promotes the map. Beyond the housekeeping residual this also exposes the
> per-hop MAC retry rate (`mac_tx_unicast_retry`/`_success`) and CCA failures —
> direct inputs to the §10 retry factor and contention picture.

## §5 Discovery & onboarding

Broker-first, not port-scan-first. The only mandatory user input is the broker
address and credentials; nearly everything else falls out of retained topics:

1. **Connect to broker** → subscribe `+/bridge/info`. Every Z2M instance
   announces its base topic, version, network settings (channel, PAN id), and
   adapter configuration — including the adapter URL, which for network
   coordinators (`tcp://ip:port`) hands us the coordinator endpoint T2 needs.
2. **Registries** → `bridge/devices` and `bridge/groups` per instance: IEEE
   addresses, friendly names, vendor/model definitions, Router vs EndDevice,
   power source, exposed capabilities, group membership.
3. **Channel map** → instances sharing a Zigbee channel are flagged: they share
   one airtime pool, and §10 accounts for them jointly.
4. **Controller detection** → presence of the HA discovery prefix (from
   `bridge/info`) suggests HA; the GUI offers the HA integration tile. In add-on
   mode (fast-follow), the Supervisor API provides broker and HA connectivity
   automatically.
5. **Hardware enrichment** → recognized network coordinators (e.g. SMLIGHT SLZB
   series) expose their own HTTP health APIs (uptime, temperature, link state);
   offered as an optional enrichment tile.
6. **Subnet scan** → exists only as an explicit opt-in for exotic setups the
   broker can't reveal. Never default.

Onboarding ends at the **permission plan**: the visibility matrix rendered
against this installation, showing current coverage (T0 by definition) and
precisely what each grantable tile would add.

## §6 Permission tiles & footprint

A **tile** is one grantable capability against one named target:

| Tile | Target | Deploy mechanism | Revoke mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Broker telemetry (T0.5) | broker | Broker debug logging **+ a broker-side log reader** (see §4 T0.5 live correction) — not pure-MQTT on Mosquitto | Remove reader + revert config |
| Z2M extension (T1) | per Z2M instance | `bridge/request/extension/save` over MQTT | `bridge/request/extension/remove` |
| Wire tap (T2) | per capture host | Copy-paste one-liner installer (default); SSH-automated (opt-in) | GUI revoke → agent self-uninstalls; or local `ninja-tap uninstall` |
| Topology pulls | per Z2M instance | Grant + rate limit (networkmap requests load the mesh) | Toggle off |
| HA entities (MQTT discovery) | per Z2M instance | Grant → standing publisher of retained discovery configs + state topics on the shared broker (§14) | Revoke → every retained topic the tile claimed is deleted (empty retained publish) |
| Calibration benchmark | per coordinator | Per-run authorization through the wizard (§11) | Abort button; grants never persist across runs |
| HA integration | HA instance | User-pasted long-lived token | Delete token |
| Hardware enrichment | per coordinator device | Enable API polling | Toggle off |
| SSH convenience | per host | User-supplied key, encrypted at rest; used only to automate deploy/remove of other tiles | Delete key |

The wire-tap tile's GUI-managed lifecycle (deploy/revoke) is not yet
implemented: until it lands, the footprint page lists connected tap agents
read-only (hello metadata, bytes streamed, covered flows) and removal is the
local `ninja-tap uninstall`.

Tile state machine: `available → granted → deployed → (degraded) → revoked`.
Every deployed artifact is version-stamped and heartbeats to the collector; the
**footprint page** shows each one with health, version drift (probe schema ≠
collector's bundled version → offer redeploy), and one-click removal. A
**revoke-all** control tears down every active probe: extensions removed via
MQTT, agents commanded to self-uninstall, broker config reverted or revert
instructions surfaced.

## §7 Probe designs

### §7.1 Z2M extension — `zigbee-ninja-probe.js`

- **Form:** one dependency-free JS file (Z2M extensions can't `npm install`),
  built and unit-tested in-repo, embedded into the collector image, deployed per
  instance over MQTT.
- **Hooks:** Z2M's extension context (eventBus, mqtt, zigbee, logger, settings —
  per the documented extension API). The exact stable hook inventory across Z2M
  2.x is milestone M3's opening spike (S3); the design assumes at minimum
  message-in/message-out visibility with device identity, which the documented
  events provide.
- **Emits:** batched compact arrays (not verbose JSON) on
  `<base>/zigbee-ninja/probe/{events,stats,heartbeat}`, QoS 0, flushed every 1 s
  or 500 events. Riding the instance's own base topic inherits existing broker
  ACLs.
- **Event record:** monotonic + wall timestamps, direction, target (IEEE/group),
  endpoint, cluster, command, payload *size* (never payload contents by default —
  a toggleable deep-capture mode exists for burst forensics), status/error,
  request-response correlation where Z2M provides it, queue milestones where
  observable.
- **Self-limits:** fixed-size internal buffer, drop-and-count under pressure
  (drops reported in heartbeat — self-accounting extends to the probe itself),
  kill-switch topic, honors `extension/remove`.

### §7.2 Wire-tap agent — `ninja-tap`

- **Philosophy: dumb agent, smart collector.** The agent knows nothing about
  Zigbee. It shells out to `tcpdump` (BSD-licensed system binary) with a BPF
  filter built from the coordinator endpoints discovery found, and streams raw
  filtered pcap to the collector over an outbound, token-authenticated WebSocket.
  All TCP reassembly and protocol decoding happens centrally. A ~200-line
  auditable script is easier to trust, review, and update than a parser fleet.
- **Install:** GUI mints a scoped agent token and renders a one-liner plus the
  raw script for review. Installs a systemd unit with CPU/memory caps and reduced
  privileges (capture capability only). The SSH tile can run the same installer
  remotely for users who opt into convenience.
- **Resilience:** outbound-only connectivity; size-capped local ring buffer when
  the collector is unreachable; explicit drop accounting beyond the cap.
  Uninstall via GUI revoke (self-removal command) or locally.
- **One agent, many flows:** on a hypervisor host bridging several Z2M guests, a
  single agent captures all coordinator flows crossing the bridge.

### §7.3 ASH/EZSP decoder (collector-side)

- TCP stream reassembly (single long-lived flow per coordinator; sequence-based
  dedupe of retransmits) → ASH deframing (escaping, CRC, seq/ack,
  DATA/ACK/NAK/RST) → EZSP frame parse.
- Command coverage is deliberately narrow: the send paths
  (unicast/multicast/broadcast), `messageSentHandler` (delivery status),
  `incomingMessageHandler` (APS frame + per-frame LQI/RSSI), stack status, and
  counter reads if S2 lands. Everything else is length-accounted but not
  deep-parsed.
- EZSP protocol version is read from the version handshake when the capture spans
  a Z2M restart, else inferred from the instance's Z2M version and validated by
  CRC/shape coherence.
- **Clean-room constraint:** ported from zigbee-herdsman (MIT) semantics or
  written from the Silicon Labs UG100 spec — never from bellows/zigpy (GPL, §16).
  Golden pcap fixtures anchor the test suite (spike S1).
- **Deep parameter decode** (`decode/ezsp_params.py`) covers exactly the frames
  the capacity and latency models need: the send paths, `messageSentHandler`,
  `incomingMessageHandler` (APS frame, sender, per-frame LQI/RSSI), route
  records, network-status/route-error callbacks, and counter-read responses.
  Field layouts are pinned **empirically against live captures** (EZSP v14-era
  encoding: 32-bit `sl_status`, 16-bit message tags, rx-packet-info struct) and
  every parser self-checks the frame's internal length arithmetic — a firmware
  layout change degrades to a visible `layout_mismatch` counter, never to
  silently wrong numbers. v13-era layouts are added only when pinned against a
  real v13 capture.

### §7.4 HA integration

With a long-lived token, the collector subscribes to HA's WebSocket event stream
(`automation_triggered`, `script_started`, `call_service`). An `mqtt.publish`
service call carries its target topic; its context id (or parent context)
resolves to the automation/script run that fired it, so a chain's commander
becomes *automation X / script Y / UI user Z*.

**This is the primary commander-attribution path** — the broker-safe replacement
for T0.5, which cannot deliver per-PUBLISH client ids over MQTT on Mosquitto
(see §4 T0.5). It is read-only against HA (no writes, no broker change) and
strictly more informative than a client id on a single-controller install.
Implemented in `ingest/hacontrol.py`; the commander it resolves takes precedence
over any broker-log client id in the chain builder. Device area/name enrichment
via the HA registries is a later add-on to the same connection.

## §8 Event pipeline & time model

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  IN["Ingest adapters (T0 / T0.5 / T1 / T2 / HA)"] --> NORM["Normalize + clock align"]
  NORM --> FUSE["Fuse and dedup frames"]
  FUSE --> ATTR["Attribution engine"]
  ATTR --> CAP["Airtime + capacity models"]
  CAP --> ST[("Chains, series, snapshots")]
  ST --> API["REST + WebSocket"]
  API --> UI["GUI"]
```

- **Normalization:** every source adapter emits canonical events (source,
  instance, monotonic + wall timestamps, kind, payload). Probes report their own
  clocks; the collector estimates a per-source offset continuously (EWMA over
  paired observations — the same command seen at broker, extension, and wire
  within milliseconds is a natural alignment signal) and exposes residual skew as
  a data-quality metric.
- **Fusion:** one physical frame may be observed at T1 and T2. Records fuse on
  (instance, direction, address, sequence/APS counter, time proximity) into a
  single FrameRecord carrying per-tier annotations. Disagreement is itself
  signal: T2-only frames quantify what Z2M-level observation misses; T1-only
  frames flag capture gaps.
- **Watermarks:** attribution windows close on a lateness watermark (~2 s). Live
  views show provisional classifications immediately; storage persists finalized
  ones. A small reorder buffer absorbs cross-source jitter.

## §9 Attribution engine

Three orthogonal, joinable dimensions per frame/chain — all derived from generic
sources:

**(1) Causality class.** A command intake (MQTT `/set`|`/get`|bridge request,
with client identity from T0.5) opens a chain: matching TX frames (group targets
expanded via the registry), then response traffic inside an adaptive window
(reads longer, sets shorter; default ≈1.5 s). Classes:

- `commanded` — TX caused by an external MQTT command.
- `provoked` — responses inside a chain window: default responses, read
  responses, post-set report echoes.
- `autonomous` — reports arriving outside any window: sensor telemetry, physical
  actuation.
- `controller-housekeeping` — Z2M's own radio work (availability pings, config
  readbacks, OTA checks), identified directly at T1 or by periodicity patterns.
- `stack-housekeeping` — NCP-internal NWK maintenance: counter-residual if S2
  lands (`measured`), else protocol-constant model (`modeled`).
- `retry-overhead` — APS/MAC retransmission cost, from delivery-status callbacks,
  counters, and the calibrated retry factor.
- `self` — zigbee-ninja's own operations (P4).

**(2) Device & message taxonomy.** Registry join: vendor/model, Router vs
EndDevice, mains vs battery, exposed capability class (light, switch, sensor,
cover, climate, lock…). Message taxonomy: command-set / command-get / report /
action-event / availability / OTA / ZDO; unicast vs groupcast vs broadcast.
"Light set commands vs sensor reporting" falls out of this join on any Z2M
system.

**(3) Commander identity.** MQTT client id (T0.5) with user-assignable labels;
the HA tile upgrades HA-client commands to automation/script/user granularity via
context-id correlation. Non-HA controllers (Node-RED, scripts) attribute at
client granularity automatically.

The default "HA usage" headline = `commanded + provoked` for HA-labeled clients;
every bucket stays independently visible. A **redundant-command detector**
(identical payload to the same target within a configurable window,
cross-referenced by commander) ships as a first-class report — near-duplicate
commands are the cheapest utilization win an automation author can act on.

## §10 Capacity & airtime model

**Per-frame airtime** (802.15.4, 2.4 GHz O-QPSK, 250 kbps → 32 µs/byte):

```text
airtime(frame) = (6 PHY-overhead bytes + PSDU_len) × 32 µs
              + ACK (11 bytes on air ≈ 352 µs, unicast only)
              + IFS (LIFS 640 µs if PSDU > 18 B, else SIFS 192 µs)
              + CSMA backoff expectation (calibrated factor)
```

PSDU length is reconstructed from the exact APS payload length at T2 plus
deterministic MAC/NWK/APS header + security overhead arithmetic (provenance
`reconstructed`; truly `measured` bytes arrive only with T3). Two documented
approximations: TX unicasts from a concentrator may carry a source-route
subframe the EZSP boundary can't see (TX PSDUs are lower bounds), and RX
airtime counts the final hop only until topology-based hop expansion lands.
The CSMA-backoff term above defaults to **0 µs before calibration**: mean
backoff is idle listening rather than channel occupancy, and η<sub>CSMA</sub>
in denominator 1 already discounts CSMA overhead — calibration may later move
cost between the two knobs, never double-count it. At T1 the same
reconstruction applies to ZCL payload sizes (near-exact); T0 estimates via a
payload→ZCL mapping table (`inferred`).

**Unicast cost:** `hops × (frame + ACK + IFS) × (1 + retry_rate)`. Hop counts
come from topology snapshots (parent/route data); unknown routes default to a
conservative 1–2 hops, tagged accordingly.

**Groupcast/broadcast cost (mesh amplification):** a group command is a single
coordinator TX, but it rides an NWK broadcast that every router relays — with up
to 3 transmissions each under passive-ack retry rules, and no MAC ACKs. Model:
`(1 + N_routers) × frame_airtime × avg_tx`, with `avg_tx ∈ [1, 3]` (default
1.3). **avg_tx is measured passively, per coordinator**, from the harvested
`readAndClearCounters` windows (Zigbee2MQTT's ember watchdog polls them on a
fixed hourly interval, so windows are ~3600 s; the acceptance guard admits up
to two fused windows): `(mac_tx_broadcast − modeled radius-1 link-status TXs)
/ (APS broadcasts + MTORR route discoveries)` is the coordinator's own
passive-ack retransmission factor — provenance `measured (coordinator tx,
generalized to relays)`, EWMA'd across windows, replacing the default as
samples arrive. One honesty gate applies: `mac_tx_broadcast` also counts the
coordinator's *relays* of other nodes' NWK broadcasts (route requests and the
like), traffic that never crosses the EZSP boundary and cannot be subtracted —
so a window whose residual exceeds the passive-ack maximum of 3 is provably
relay-contaminated and is **discarded and counted** (visible in the GUI), never
clamped into a fake ceiling value. On meshes with steady relay traffic the
modeled default simply stays in force, visibly. This supersedes the groupcast
calibration stage originally specified in §11 (passive by default, P1). The
amplification term is what explains why "one more group" costs far more
airtime than coordinator counters suggest.

**Topology snapshots** (router census, parent/route tables, depth estimates)
come from permission-gated, rate-limited networkmap pulls — they load the mesh,
so they're sparse, scheduled, and self-attributed. Between pulls, per-frame
LQI/RSSI at T2 keeps link-quality trends fresh for free.

**Denominators — three, reported side-by-side:**

1. **Channel airtime budget:** 250 kbps × η<sub>CSMA</sub> (default 0.7,
   calibrated). Instances sharing a channel draw from one pooled budget —
   discovery's channel map drives joint accounting. Foreign networks and Wi-Fi
   remain invisible until T3; the GUI says so rather than pretending.
2. **NCP throughput knee:** sustainable frames/s before the latency knee, from
   calibration (§11).
3. **Pipeline service rate:** Z2M's effective command throughput, from T1 queue
   timing.

**Outputs:** utilization percent per denominator; steady headroom (knee − p95
rate) and burst headroom (knee − peak rate; persisted rollups are 10 s, so
burst granularity is 10 s until 1 s series persist); latency SLIs (enqueue→TX,
TX→delivery-confirm, command→state-echo); error SLIs (BUSY, delivery failures) —
plotted against load. That last scatter enables **continuous knee validation**
from natural traffic, catching capacity regressions (firmware updates, mesh
drift) without waiting for a re-benchmark. Knee semantics carry through: a
ramp that ended in driver saturation contributes the *pipeline* per-device
ceiling (denominator 3) and a lower bound for the NCP knee, never a false
"measured" denominator 2.

## §11 Calibration benchmark

A guided wizard, per coordinator, per-run authorized (grants never persist):

1. **Target selection** — mains-powered routers ranked by suitability (healthy
   link LQI from the latest topology snapshot, then the least-entangled device:
   fewer bindings and group memberships); the user picks.
2. **Dry-run preview** — exact traffic to be generated (topic and payload),
   the full step schedule, hard caps, stop rules, and watchdog conditions,
   shown before anything transmits. The preview mints a **single-use,
   short-TTL authorization token**; starting the run requires echoing it, and
   nothing persists across runs. A **fleet batch** is authorized the same
   way: one preview enumerates every planned run (auto-picking each
   instance's top-ranked eligible router unless a target is pinned) and one
   single-use token covers exactly that list. Batch runs execute one at a
   time with the full cooldown between them; an abort stops the remainder;
   an item whose target vanished by its turn is skipped with a durable
   `skipped` history record rather than run against a changed fleet.
3. **Ramp** — closed-loop unicast attribute reads through the instance's own
   MQTT command path (`<base>/<target>/get` of a benign, gettable attribute —
   the same path controllers use; reads actuate nothing, each reply
   republishes device state). Stepped geometric rates (~20 s per step), an
   outstanding-replies bound so a stalling mesh throttles the driver, and a
   drain pause between steps. Per step: sent/completed/timeouts, achieved
   rate, RTT percentiles, and instance delivery-failure deltas. RTT prefers
   the wire-tier `sendUnicast→messageSentHandler` SLI when a tap covers the
   coordinator and falls back to the command→state-echo path, tagged either
   way. The knee = the last step sustained before a stop rule fires: p95 RTT
   breach (vs a multiple of the step-1 baseline with an absolute floor),
   read-timeout ratio, delivery-failure budget, or **driver saturation** —
   the closed loop can no longer reach the requested rate, which measures the
   *pipeline* service ceiling (denominator 3) and bounds the NCP knee from
   below; the record says which rule ended the ramp, and a ramp that exhausts
   the schedule cleanly records a censored (lower-bound) knee. **Spread
   mode** lifts the per-device limit: reads round-robin across several
   top-ranked routers (per-target FIFOs pair each reply with its own
   device's reads) with the per-device share held under the measured
   per-device ceilings, so the aggregate ramp probes the NCP/global-pipeline
   knee — denominator 2 measured, not just bounded — while a single-target
   run keeps measuring denominator 3. (An earlier revision specified an
   optional groupcast stage against a wizard-created test group to calibrate
   the broadcast retry factor `avg_tx`; that stage is superseded — avg_tx is
   now measured passively and continuously from the coordinator's own
   broadcast counters, §10.)
4. **Safety rails** — hard rate/duration/total-read caps enforced inside the
   send loop; watchdog abort on any device on the instance going offline, on
   an error spike in the Zigbee2MQTT log, or on total reply silence; manual
   abort always live; cool-down pause after every run.
5. **Record** — per-step curves (rate, achieved, RTT percentiles per source,
   timeouts, delivery failures), the knee with its terminating rule and
   censored flag, date, Z2M version, coordinator firmware. Benchmark windows
   are flagged in history and excluded from utilization series (the reads and
   their echoes are attributed `self`). Version/firmware changes trigger a
   "recalibrate?" suggestion.

## §12 Storage & data model

Everything embedded, no external services (P7):

- **SQLite (WAL)** — configuration, registries, tiles/footprint, calibrations,
  alert rules/state, finalized chains (48 h detail, aggregates beyond), and
  rollup series.
- **Hourly Parquet segments** — raw event stream for the burst-inspector window
  (~48 h, quota-capped), queried in place by **embedded DuckDB** (MIT) for ad-hoc
  forensics without a series-cardinality explosion.

**Retention tiers:** events + 1 s series ~48 h → 10 s for 2 weeks → 1 min for 90
days → 1 h indefinitely, under a disk quota with a GUI knob; the quota manager
degrades oldest/finest first. The V1 knobs are settings-backed and editable in
the Settings view: 10 s rollup window (default 14 d, clamped 1–365), chain
detail window (default 48 h, clamped 1–720 h), and topology snapshots kept per
instance (default 20, clamped 1–200); alert-event history is fixed at 90 days.
The coarser 1 min/1 h tiers and the disk-quota degradation manager ride with
the Parquet/DuckDB raw-event store. **Cardinality budget is explicit:** per-instance
headline series at 1 s; per-device at 10 s+; per-(device × bucket) at 1 min+.
Rough sizing at a busy reference load (~150 events/s aggregate): ~13 M events/day
≈ 1.3 GB/day of Parquet — a 4–8 GB default quota holds the 48 h detail window
comfortably on small hardware.

Core entities: `Instance`, `Device`, `Group`, `Probe/Tile`, `FrameRecord`,
`Chain`, `TopologySnapshot`, `Calibration`, `SeriesPoint`,
`AlertRule/AlertEvent` — each carrying provenance (source tiers) and confidence.

## §13 API & GUI

**Backend:** Python 3.12, FastAPI; REST for configuration/queries, WebSocket for
live streams (1 s fleet counters, burst-inspector tail). **Frontend:** React +
TypeScript + Vite, dark-first but fully dual-theme; uPlot for dense/streaming
time series, d3 for structural views (attribution breakdowns, topology graph).
Static bundle served by the collector. **Auth:** single admin account (argon2)
standalone; HA ingress trust in add-on mode (fast-follow). Default port `8686`.

**V1 views:**

1. **Fleet** — per-coordinator utilization dials (airtime % and knee %), 24 h
   sparklines, active alerts, coverage meters.
2. **Coordinator detail** — stacked series by causality bucket; message-rate,
   airtime, and latency panes; error overlay; shared-channel pooling note.
   The §10 utilization/headroom outputs shipped first as the dedicated
   **Headroom** view: the three denominators side by side, steady/burst
   headroom against the calibrated knee, and the latency-vs-load
   knee-validation scatter (uPlot); Fleet cards carry the knee line.
3. **Attribution explorer** — pivotable bucket × device-class × commander matrix;
   top-N devices/automations; the redundant-command report.
4. **Wire tap** — per-coordinator wire-tier telemetry: agent/flow health
   (CRC, retransmits), airtime buckets with amplification, the wire latency
   SLI, delivery statuses, and mesh-health counters. The first slice of
   Coordinator detail, delivered as its own view while the stacked-series
   panes are pending.
5. **Burst inspector** — event-level timeline over the raw window, zoom to
   milliseconds, chain visualization (command → TX → responses as a micro-gantt).
6. **Topology** — mesh graph from the latest snapshot (LQI-weighted edges,
   relay-load-sized routers), freshness-stamped. First slice shipped: per-
   instance grant-gated on-demand pulls (15 min rate limit, one scan at a
   time), stored snapshots with summaries (router census, weak links, node
   degree, per-query sweep answers — a node that answers Mgmt_Lqi but omits
   Mgmt_Rtg is a firmware quirk, not unreachable); the force-directed graph
   rides on the stored raw maps later.
7. **Calibration** — wizard + history + knee-drift indicators. Shipped:
   ranked target picker, dry-run preview with per-run authorization, the
   fleet-batch flow (one authorization per enumerated batch, queue progress,
   abort-stops-remainder), live ramp progress with the RTT-vs-rate curve and
   an ever-present abort, and history with batch tags and an
   environment-drift "recalibrate?" chip. (The groupcast stage is superseded
   by passive avg_tx measurement — §10.)
8. **Footprint & permissions** — tiles, health, versions, revoke-all; connected
   wire-tap agents.
9. **Alerts** — rules and notification center (§14).
10. **Settings** — retention knobs (§12), client labels for the Attribution
    explorer, and the wire-tap agent token (revealed on demand).

## §14 Alerting

Threshold rules over first-class metrics, evaluated on the collector's 10 s
rollup cadence. A rule is (metric, instance or `*`, operator, threshold,
sustain window, optional clear threshold, severity); each (rule, instance)
pair runs an independent state machine:

- **open** — the condition holds continuously for the sustain window;
- **clear** — the value stays on the OK side of the clear threshold (default:
  the open threshold) for max(sustain, 60 s); the floor keeps zero-sustain
  counter rules from flapping tick to tick;
- **freeze** — missing data (an undeployed probe, an unconfigured HA link,
  no tap coverage) neither opens nor clears anything.

Metrics span capacity (knee-utilization %, steady headroom, channel budget %,
load), latency (wire p95), reliability (delivery-failure / EZSP
layout-mismatch / probe sequence-gap deltas), link health (broker and HA
connectivity, tap agent count, probe heartbeat age), and data quality
(avg_tx). Counter-style metrics evaluate as per-tick deltas: first sight
baselines silently and a cumulative decrease rebaselines, so collector
restarts never alert retroactively. Rules and events persist (event history
keeps 90 days); open events survive restarts and still require a sustained OK
reading to clear.

Built-in rules seed exactly once — user edits and deletions are durable.
Self-health rules (probe heartbeat stale, tap agent down, broker/HA link
down, layout mismatch) ship **enabled**: they only fire when something the
user deployed stops reporting. Capacity rules ship **disabled** with
placeholder thresholds — utilization and latency norms are per-installation,
so the user opts in from the Alerts view.

Delivery: the GUI notification center (active alerts ride the 1 s fleet
stream), plus the **MQTT discovery publisher** — headline metrics and alert
states as Home Assistant entities, so any HA user gets native
notifications/automations for free, tokenless, and it's the natural bridge
for non-HA consumers too. Because it is a *standing* publisher on the shared
broker, it is a per-instance grant tile (§6), never on by default. When
granted it publishes retained discovery configs (one HA device per
coordinator, `origin`-stamped entities) under the instance's announced
discovery prefix, then refreshes per-metric state topics (channel budget %,
knee utilization %, wire p95, message rate) and a `problem` binary_sensor
(active-alert state, alert names as attributes) every 45 s over the
collector's own MQTT connection (self-attributed, P4). Sensors carry
`expire_after`, so a dead collector reads *unavailable* in HA — no
availability topic or LWT to trust. A metric with no data yet simply skips
its topic. Revoking the grant publishes empty retained payloads for every
topic the tile ever claimed (bookkept per instance), removing the entities
from HA; if the broker is unreachable at revoke time, the publish loop's
cleanup sweep finishes the job when it returns.

## §15 Security posture

- **The product never requires host credentials.** Default probe deployment is
  reviewable one-liner installers; agents authenticate with per-agent scoped
  tokens, outbound-only. SSH automation is a strictly optional convenience tile.
- **Secrets** (broker creds, HA token, opt-in SSH key) are encrypted at rest:
  Fernet under a key generated on first boot in the data volume (`secret.key`,
  mode 0600, re-tightened on every boot). Ciphertext carries an `enc:` marker;
  plaintext rows from before this landed are upgraded in place at startup,
  idempotently. A ciphertext that no longer decrypts (key replaced) resolves
  to "unconfigured" and is repaired by re-entering the secret in the GUI.
  Honest threat model: the key sits beside the database, so volume compromise
  = secrets compromise — this protects the DB file alone (backups, exports,
  casual inspection), nothing more; a passphrase-locked mode is a later
  hardening step, documented as such.
- **Blast radius:** read-only by default (P1); every active operation is
  server-side rate-limited; benchmarks are double-confirmed per run and
  wizard-supervised.
- **Payload privacy:** probes report sizes and metadata, not payload contents,
  unless deep-capture is explicitly toggled for forensics.
- **Probe integrity:** versioned artifacts, schema handshake with the collector,
  drift → redeploy prompt. No telemetry, no phone-home. Image signing (cosign)
  once releases begin.

## §16 Licensing & IP hygiene

- **Apache-2.0**, DCO sign-off on contributions. Inbound-under-Apache
  contribution terms keep the codebase commercially forkable without a CLA.
- **Dependency policy:** no GPL/AGPL code in distributed artifacts. Named
  exclusions: bellows, zigpy, scapy. Named inclusions: zigbee-herdsman as a
  porting *reference* (MIT), dpkt (BSD) if packet-parsing helpers are needed,
  DuckDB (MIT), uPlot (MIT), FastAPI (MIT), tcpdump invoked as an external system
  binary (BSD). A NOTICE file and a CI license check (`tools/license_check.py`)
  enforce the policy.
- **Trademark:** "Zigbee" is a CSA mark; community-tool naming precedent
  (zigbee2mqtt) applies.

## §19 Risks & spikes

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation / spike |
|---|---|---|
| ASH/EZSP decode effort or version drift | T2 slips | **S1:** capture ~10 min of a live coordinator flow and decode offline *before* M4 commits; golden fixtures pin the suite; port from MIT herdsman |
| EmberZNet counter access route impractical from extension context | Stack-housekeeping stays modeled | **S2 (resolved):** Z2M's own `readAndClearCounters` polls are harvested passively at T2 and labeled (§4); labels stay `inferred` until validated live |
| Z2M extension hook inventory shifts across 2.x releases | T1 fragility | **S3:** enumerate stable hooks; schema handshake; CI matrix against pinned Z2M docker versions |
| Mosquitto debug-log volume/format drift | T0.5 attribution gaps | Verify format + measure overhead early in M2; version-keyed tolerant parser; feature degrades to client-anonymous cleanly |
| Series cardinality on small hardware (Pi add-on audience) | Resource blowups | Explicit cardinality budget (§12), quota-driven degradation, Parquet+DuckDB for detail instead of series explosion |
| Benchmark misbehavior on production meshes | User trust | §11 rails; per-run authorization; supervised first runs |
| Clock skew across probes/hosts | Bad chains/fusion | Continuous offset estimation with skew as a visible health metric; watermarked finalization |
| Shared-channel and foreign-traffic blind spots | Airtime denominator optimistic | Pooled accounting for co-channel instances; honest confidence tags; T3 reserved for ground truth |
